## Data-Analysis-Portfolio

My SQL and Data analysis projects portfolio.

Welcome to my **Data Analysis Portfolio**, where I showcase projects focused on **SQL** and **Excel-based business analytics**.  
Each project explores real-world datasets and applies analytical techniques to extract insights, trends, and performance metrics.  
Here are some of my SQL projects:
